        "Peer-to-Peer lending platforms like LendingClub became popular after the Great Recession when credit tightened. Due to several factors, LendingClub transitioned away from a P2P model towards institutional lenders [@jagtiani_lemieux_2018], similar to those now involved in private credit. There is interest in private credit for investors seeking diversified, higher-yielding income sources because US household debt is at a record 18.59 trillion [New York Federal Reserve @NYFed2025]. We want to learn from LendingClub's data to help inform investment decisions in the a future credit-tightening cycle.\n",

        "Prior work by [@Change2015] focused on predicting defaults. We belive that there is much greater utility for an investor to know how much they can make rather than a loan that defaults. In our EDA, we can see that approximately 6.8% of loans that defaulted still have a positive return for investors because the interest rate is sufficiently high and the loans defaulted later in the term."
