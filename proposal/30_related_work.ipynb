    "[@Trinh2024] used a similar peer-to-peer lending data and modeled credit risk with 9 different statistical and machine learning models. They concluded that Gradient Boosting Decision Tree is the best model for most of the evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "[@Change2015] used Lending Club data and fit Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes. They concluded that Naive Bayes with Gaussian performs the best at predicting default rate. Furthermore, by applying the best model, the investment return could grow by 50%.\n",

    "[@Souadda2025] evaluated hyperparameter optimization methods for machine learning models with similar lending data, and Bayesian methods (Hyperopt, Optuna) achieved 75.7 times faster runtime than Grid Search while maintaining similar accuracy.\n"
