    "Target: Loan status with a binary default indicator (Charged Off vs Fully Paid/Current), more multi-class labels for optional granular analysis.\n",
    "Dataset split: loans with observed outcomes are retained, and a time-aware train/validation/test split is applied to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "Preprocessing: handling missing values, consolidating rare categories, encoding categorical variables, standardization. Class weighting or stratified sampling to address class imbalance.\n",
    "Modeling: Logistic regression as baseline. Tree-based models (random forest, gradient boosting) as comparisons.\n",
    "Evaluation: AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1, and calibration metrics.\n",
    "Hyperparameters are tuned via cross-validation, and feature importance is analyzed to interpret default risk drivers. Robustness is assessed across loan grades and time periods."
