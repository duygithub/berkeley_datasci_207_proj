        "We will model loan outcomes using supervised learning on the LendingClub dataset. The target variable will be loan status, which we will convert into a binary default indicator (e.g., Charged Off vs Fully Paid/Current) and, where appropriate, a multi-class label for more granular analysis. We will filter the data to loans with observed outcomes and perform a time-aware split into train/validation/test to avoid leakage from later vintages.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will clean and preprocess features by handling missing values, consolidating rare categories, and encoding categorical variables (one-hot or target encoding depending on cardinality). Continuous variables will be standardized for models that are scale-sensitive. We will also evaluate class imbalance and apply techniques such as class weights or stratified sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will start with interpretable baselines (logistic regression) and compare against tree-based models (random forest, gradient boosting). Model performance will be evaluated using AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1, and calibration metrics. We will tune hyperparameters via cross-validation and report feature importance to interpret drivers of default risk. Finally, we will assess robustness across loan grades and time periods."
