        "We model loan outcomes using supervised learning on the LendingClub dataset. Loan status is transformed into a binary default indicator (Charged Off vs Fully Paid/Current), with an optional multi-class label for granular analysis. Only loans with observed outcomes are retained, and a time-aware train/validation/test split is applied to prevent leakage across vintages.\n",

        "Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, consolidating rare categories, and encoding categorical variables using one-hot or target encoding based on cardinality. Scale-sensitive models use standardized continuous features. Class imbalance is addressed through class weighting or stratified sampling.\n",

        "We begin with interpretable baselines (logistic regression) and compare them with tree-based models (random forest, gradient boosting). Performance is evaluated using AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1, and calibration metrics. Hyperparameters are tuned via cross-validation, and feature importance is analyzed to interpret default risk drivers. Robustness is assessed across loan grades and time periods."
